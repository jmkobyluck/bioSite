                                Seth has always been a good friend. From the moment we met, we were an unbreakable force. Of course, Superman was also an unbreakable force and, I believe, that's why Seth was so fond of him from the beginning.
                                Seth always had the power to influence others and is a natural born leader. The development of his tight-knit family is evidence.

                        <p>Family has always been an important aspect in Seth's life. I guess that was clear from the beginnning when he was introduced to his future High School Sweetheart. He and Krista were always a close-knit unit and were able to survive the transition from teen to adult. A full family resulted and none of them could be happier.</p>

        <p>Seth has always been a good friend. From the moment we met, we were an unbreakable force. Of course, Superman was also an unbreakble force and, I believe, that's why Seth was so fond of him from the beginning. 
        Seth always had the power to influence others and is a natural born leader. The development of his tight-knit family is evidence.</p>

<section class="wife">
<div class="container">
    <h1>Wife</h1>

    <div class="wife-txt">
        <p>Family has always been an important aspect in Seth's life. I guess that was clear from the beginnning when he was introduced to his future High School Sweetheart. He and Krista were always a close-knit unit and were able to survive the transition from teen to adult. A full family resulted and none of them could be happier.</p>

        <p>To be a father is an enormous accomplishment and Seth has it down in spades. Him and Krista have such an abundant love for Aniyah an Rowan, it engorges the hearts of even the most stale personalities with admiration and envy.</p>

        <p>All in all, Seth juggles the life of father, husband, friend, web developer, and so much more. He does a pretty fine job of displaying to the world his dedication and support to the people in his life and chooses to work his life around those aspects instead of working those aspects around his life.</p>
